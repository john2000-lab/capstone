    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>We are a group of graduating students working on our capstone project, a Micro Weather Station. Our goal is to create a weather station that is affordable, easy to use, and can provide accurate weather data to users.</p>
    
    <h2>What is a Weather Station?</h2>
    <p>A weather station is a device that measures various atmospheric conditions, such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall, and more. It typically consists of several sensors that are connected to a data logger or microcontroller, which collects and stores the data. Weather stations can be used for a variety of purposes, such as weather forecasting, agriculture, aviation, and research.</p>
